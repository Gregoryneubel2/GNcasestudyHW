## Recommendations
 
* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
 
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
 
* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
 
* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?:
 
The recommendation I would make to the companies in the same domain is providing the opportunity to the clients to access on their  digital platforms to purchase digital coins as well as stock/equities investment trading opportunities. Provide digital wallet as well. A lot of the big commercial institutions have not yet provided the access and are falling behind to the digital apps that are ahead of the curve.
